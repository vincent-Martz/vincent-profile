		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2> 


	    <h3>Rugby</h3>  
	    <p>I've been playing rugby for 10 years, this sport has given me a great team spirit, helping each other and sharing. This sport with real values is for me the way to let off steam, to have fun, to enjoy myself and to surpass myself. </p> 

	    <h3>Extreme sports</h3> 
	    <p>I started riding at the age of 4, this sport has now become my passion. Never having given up, with the desire to always be more and better, I joined a club to compete at a regional level. I also took part in the mythical Le Touquet Paris Plage race. My dream in this discipline is to later take part in the Paris Dakar race. 
        Motocross allows me to find myself, to enjoy my passion and has taught me to never give up and to give my best to perform.

        Furthermore, I have been doing freestyle skiing since I was 11 years old. I have also taken part in regional competitions. This sport has allowed me to surpass myself, to overcome fear and stress, to take only the positive and to train hard. 

        I also surf, wakeboard, monoski, kitsurf and karting. I need to practice extreme sports to feel alive. By doing all these sports I feel free and I find a perfect balance. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Travels</h3>  
	    <p>I love to travel, I have already discovered a lot of countries, and I want to discover many more. 
        Travelling allows me to enrich myself culturally, to take only good from the people of the world, to discover their lives, their
        customs, their way of thinking. 
        I love discovering the world.</p>
